   <p2> Hello, my name is Gabriel. My mom promised me a trip to Bali in the summer if I recieve a good grade in Mr. Nandins class. I did all my work in class, yet Nandin refuses to take back the zero he gave me. Since I have a poor grade, my mom said I can't go to Bali. Please help me raise money so I can fly to Bali by myself. </p>
